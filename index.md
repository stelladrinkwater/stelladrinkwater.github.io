_my practice lies in the intersection of sound and code. i often feel torn between the analog and the digital. i wish to dissolve this tension._

i'm currently pursuing a <ins>b.sc. with a combined major in computer science and music</ins>.

"greatest hits" list of some of my projects: scoring for VR (and traditional) film, developing a VR experience with a team of students through the [PXR XRtist Link Up](https://performanceandxr.com/initiatives/xrtist-link-up/) program, creating audio applications in python + max, [producing educational videos about music technology](https://youtu.be/va4UkxFtGmY), performing with my band [shark bite spite](https://sharkbitespite.carrd.co) (vocals/guitar/synth/drums/bass), and completing a VKURA research project on spatial audio mixing for [Paul Walde's Glacial](https://paulwalde.bandcamp.com/album/glacial?from=search&search_item_id=3876905523&search_item_type=a&search_match_part=?&search_page_id=3878063983&search_page_no=1&search_rank=1&search_sig=98c3993dd7d917ddb6fddd1c5b0318df). 

my decade+ of guitar practice and my background in theatre (2018-2021: sound designer for 6 shows) grounds my understanding of live sound, composition, and storytelling.

i want to build things with people who value deep attention and love their work. _if that's you..._ and you're looking for someone who has ~~endless~~ patience for troubleshooting, a strong motor in their heart, and experience with all kinds of audio tech, reach out.

Why writing notes is important:

It frees up mental space. Mental space is especially important to mathematicians and engineers and  creatives. Mental space is working memory. Mental space is RAM. (Mental space can even be VRAM, if you have a visual mind.)

I came to this realization forcibly. I had a serious concussion and I got into meditation around the same time. One of these things (or the compounding of the two) led me to have less episodic memory than I seem to remember having before. Yet, with less memory, I felt myself become more present and that I had greater ability to rearrange equations in my head (and furthermore, to dream up creative engineering ideas and spin them around in my mind). 

I had more airspace auditorally in my mind too. More thoughts were happening simultaneously. (This could also just be a phase of brain development. It's idiomatic to lose your memory as you get older and to have more complex thoughts as your brain develops.)

Because of my anxiety about having less episodic memory (being able to remember my days and weeks less well) I started taking brief notes about what I did each day. As I was taking notes about was doing, I started to project manage (my solo projects) on paper and track progress in a linear way. That tracking gave me extra motivation and clarity.

I think one reason that people who have never gotten into taking notes/journalling don't do it is because they overestimate their memory and their ability to plan things on the fly. Before, I didn't realize that holding all of this information in my head was holding back my processing speed. 

There is a transition period. Once you start journaling space doesn’t open up immediately (because your brain is still holding onto things). Once you learn to trust the journal and refer to it regularly and put things out of your mind once they're in the journal, the only thing you have to remember is where your journal is. I don't remember my to-do list for tomorrow. It's just in the journal. I'll check it tomorrow. This empty space in my mind where my to-do lists (and everything else I now write down) used to be gives me so much peace when I’m resting. And beyond that, it gives me focus, clarity, and speed when I’m working. 

There are some professions where memory is very important (this type of long-term memory that I have personally offloaded to written words and diagrams). I think doctors (for example) really need to have an internalized mental index of information. I think creatives and engineers can get the most benefit from creating a note-taking system that optimizes for regained mental space.

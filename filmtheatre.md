I remember mixing ~12-20 lav mics every show, and there were at least 7 dates. They really wanted to mic the ensemble. Used a Yamaha QL series sound board we had at the school, great digital parametric EQ and everything. Started using busses for the first time. There was even a live band.

Sound designer and live sound technician. It was really fun working with Grace, it was a beautiful script about an old house in Alberta and the stories of the people who lived in and passed through it.

This was a musical during lockdown era, so I recorded all the vocals at a distance. 

Did some sound design in QLab as well. Ripped SFX from youtube and cued it live.
